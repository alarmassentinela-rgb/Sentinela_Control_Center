## Activities
- **Mikrotik Integration (sentinela_subscriptions):**
  - Resolved access rights (ACL) issues for the `sentinela.router` model.
  - Successfully installed `routeros_api` library in the Odoo container.
  - Verified real-time connection to Mikrotik RB750r2 (IP: 192.168.3.3).
  - Implemented **Mikrotik Profile Management**: Odoo can now create/update speed profiles (rate-limit) directly on the router.
  - Automated **PPPoE Secret Provisioning**: Activating a subscription now creates the user/password/profile in Mikrotik.

- **Subscription UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Added auto-calculation for `next_billing_date` based on start date and interval.
  - Added automatic price population from the selected product.
  - Implemented `price_total` to show the monthly fee with IVA included.
  - **Dynamic Filtering:** The service address dropdown now strictly shows only the selected customer's branches.
  - Added a readonly **Address Preview** (Street, City, Zip) in the subscription form for quick verification.
  - Added **Service Category** filtering: Choosing "Internet WISP" now only shows relevant internet plans.

- **Status:**
  - `sentinela_subscriptions` updated to version v29.
  - API connection to local Mikrotik is operational.

## Pending Tasks
- Import active contracts from MasAdmin.
- Test the "Suspension" hook (auto-disabling PPPoE secrets).
- Refine the automated notification system (Email/n8n).
